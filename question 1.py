x=float(input("first number"))#this will ask the user the first number
y=float(input("second number"))#will ask the second number
z=float(input("third number"))#will ask the third number
average=(x+y+z)/3#this equation will calculate the average of 3 numbers
print("average of 3 numbers=",average)#this will print the calculated average of the three numbers
